Scheduling: OS Scheduler
A concept tied to thread is scheduling. 
Scheduling referes to operating system ability to decide which thread executes at any given time
Computer has limited processing power so you want to make sure urgent thread gets process first.
All threads are competing for computational power

How to increase computer power to process multiple threads at same time?
1) Increase CPU core so at one time you can balance thread loads by giving it to different cpu cores. One core can process multiple cores by process called multithreading
2) The time in which a thread is sitting idle, it can execute other tasks.

What do you mean by thread sitting idle?
Imagine your one thread has a task of reading a file from hard drives. once finishes file reading count number of letters in it.
In the time when your computer is reading file. your thread is sitting idle waiting for cpu to finsih reading file.
This concept is called as input/output takes time I/O time.
You OS scheduler has the ability to detect this downtime
During that idle time you can give that thread other tasks to do

How this applies to NodeJs??
